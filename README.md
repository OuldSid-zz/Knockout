This repository contains all of the sample code for the book Mastering KnockoutJS. Each sample is on its own branch, in the format cp[chapter-number]-[sample-name]. For example *cp1-contacts* contains the contacts sample for Chapter 1. 


How to Use
===

If you using Git to browse the code then simply clone the repository

`clone git@github.com:tyrsius/MasteringKnockout.git`

Then checkout the sample you want to view with the checkout command

`git checkout cp1-contacts`

This is the recommended way to interact with the code samples.

Using Without Git
===

If you do not have Git installed, and you don't want to install it, you can download the code manually sample-by-sample. First, selecte the branch you want from the branch dropdown.

Then, press the download as zip button.

This will give you a zipped copy of the sample. You would need to do this for each sample. Obviously this is very labor intensive, which is why I recommend using Git and just checking out each sample as you want to view it.
